Copying pipeline.stats R script

==== Prepping Data ====
- using the "main" data set
- working off the "trimmed" qc report

<cd /shared/slate_group1/Shared/methylated_soay/soay_wgbs_main_sep2024/nextflow_pipeline/qc>

--> CAN'T ACCESS THIS FROM A WORKER NODE!

- pulling out the correct columns for downstream analysis

<cat multiqc_fastqc_TRIMMED.txt | cut -f '2 5 9 10 11'>

- BUT need to save this to the correct area
- new directory in my area called methylation_downstream/qc
/users/bip23lrb/methylation_downstream

- making the SHORT_multiqc to save in my area
<cat multiqc_fastqc_TRIMMED.txt | cut -f '2 5 9 10 11' > /users/bip23lrb/methylation_downstream/qc/SHORT_multiqc_fastqc_TRIMMED.txt>

- this is written
- trying to download onto computer to analyse in R on local computer
- saved in the MLcode project area

====== Samtools Output =========
** this will need to be done fully on the HPC **
- this is all in the alignment_stats/ directory
<cd /shared/slate_group1/Shared/methylated_soay/soay_wgbs_main_sep2024/nextflow_pipeline/alignment_stats>

- making the output file in my area -> samtools_out.txt

for f in *.samtools_stats.txt; 
do
echo "sample: $f" >> /users/bip23lrb/methylation_downstream/qc/samtools_out.txt
sed -n '1p; 8p; 19p; 24p' "$f" >> /users/bip23lrb/methylation_downstream/qc/samtools_out.txt
done

====== Average Coverage =====
- not found a matching file name to the pipeline.stats.R code
- guessing that the coverage is the "merged.bismark.cov.gz" file in the methylation area?
- each sample has a merged.bismark file which contains the CpG location and proportion reads that are methylated/ unmethylated and total number of reads?
- 

===== Breadth of Coverage =====
- each sample has a breadth file at various coverage levels
- this is saved in alignment_stats in the shared area
- the breadth file just contains one number
	- cat will just print the number so should be fairly easy to pull them all together
- there are several "coverage thresholds"
	- 4x, 5x, 6x, 8x, 10x, 15x, 20x, 25x
- the pipeline.stats.R code calculates the percent of genome covered at different read depth/ coverage thresholds and then combines them into one dataframe

** again this chunk of code relies on having access to the files on the HPC which on stanage can't access shared area
- alternative plan, extract the file names and coverage into several text files which contain coverage and sample ID to then transfer into R later

/shared/slate_group1/Shared/methylated_soay/soay_wgbs_main_sep2024/nextflow_pipeline/alignment_stats

----- for loop -----

for f in *_10x.txt ;
do 
content=$(cat $f)
echo "$f, $content" >> /users/bip23lrb/methylation_downstream/qc/coverage_10x.txt
done

---- in R ----
- once all the files have been made can combine them with a column for each coverage and sample ID
- can also then calculate percentage based on the genome length which is in the file for the reference genome
- finally, will then be able to calculate the means etc across samples and then recreate the graphs 

====== Bisulphite Conversion Efficiency =====
- also all in the alignment_stats/ directory

- having a go at making this file

- created a space in my area for doing the analysis to
/users/bip23lrb/methylation_downstream/qc/BS_conversion_efficiency

- .BS-conversion.txt files are now in the alignment_stats directory

- the code to "copy" the BS conversion files into one 

- run each of these lines separately

 for f in *.BS-conversion; do
 cat "$f" >> /users/bip23lrb/methylation_downstream/qc/BS_conversion_efficiency
 done
